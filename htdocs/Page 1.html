	  Party: Indpendent <br/>
	  Current Government Position: Vice President of The Philippines <br/> <br/>
	  Robredo had been one of the last people to file their candidacy for president, nonetheless she has exploded onto the stage
      in fashion, quite literally. <div id= "filipinoC">"Ipakita na ang pink, hindi lang basta kulay; uri siya ng pamumuhay" </div> -Robredo. <br/><br/>
	  Perhaps it is a way to distance herself from the Liberal Party, which she ran under in 2016, and whose color is normally associated with yellow.
	  In an interview with Rappler, her running mate Kiko Pangilinan stated that they were hoping to have a "people's campaign",
	  he talked about the inclusivity of Robredo (evidenced by her Senate slate), and how social media will be crucial in the upcoming election.
	  Some of her campaign goals are: Improving the healthcare system, investment and development into the agricultural sector, have more FDIs, 
	  and a closer relationship between the government and the people.	  </td>

	  Current Government Position: Senator of The Philippines <br/> <br/>
	  A Police Chief turned Senator, he has a reputation for being a disciplinarian and taking a strong stance against corruption.
	  Similarly, his campaign goals emphasize on the reduction of crime and corruption, strict regulation of public funds, and greater accountability to local government positions.
	  He and his running mate, Vicente Sotto III, were the first to announce their bids for president and vice-president respectably.
	  In a pre-recorded livestream, both shared their rough plans on ascent to power, and had some remarks about current president Rodrigo Duterte.

	  -from livestream<br/><br/>
	  Recent polls don't look too good for Lacson, but he is unworried and says that they will take it slow and steady.
