	  Current Government Position: Politician <br/> <br/>
	  Undoubtedly the most controversial presidential candidate, the son of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos is not without popularity, coming in
	  first during a December poll. In a campaign opener in the Philippine Arena, Marcos laid out a message of unity, however not much talk
	  was made about what he planned to do once he reached Malacanang. He also talked about elevating the Philippines to new heights in the 
	  same talk. His campaign, however, has been fraught with controversies, from his longstanding downplay of martial law atrocities, to
	  multiple disqualification cases, rampant social media trolling, denial of his own involvement during the Martial Law years, lying about
	  school documents, and much more fabrications.
      <div id= "filipinoC">"Hindi naman tayo palaaway, hindi naman tayo naghahanap ng gulo." </div> -Marcos <br/><br/>
	  Despite his attempts on not stirring public dissent against him, it seems a large amount of the public still remain vigilant on the
      dictator's son.</td>

	  Another candidate people may not know: Ernesto Abella, the first and former spokesperson of current-and-soon-not-to-be president Rodrigo
	  Duterte. A pastor and teacher by profession, he was thrust into the spotlight by Duterte, his long time friend, he was also one of Duterte's
	  earliest supporters. He opened his campaign in Cavite, during this performance, he talked about reworking the current tax system to help the poor,
	  in other interviews he also shared his wish to continue the reforms and policies of Duterte with a more agricultural focus.

	  He seems to have accepted that the office of President may be too far for his reach, but hopes that people would choose him otherwise for being
	  a person of integrity.
